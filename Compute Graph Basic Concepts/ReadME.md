# Basic Graph Concepts 

Dataset Description : It contain 332 nodes and 2126 number of edges. In the file, each line represents an edge having "u v" where an edge is from u to v. 

External Libraries Used : "NetworkX" to visualizing the graph.

Written python script will cover the following concepts :

  
    - Convert the dataset into 'adjacency matrix' and 'edge list'
    - Visualize network using networkx
    - Average degree distribution
    - Average path length
    - Average Custering Coefficient
