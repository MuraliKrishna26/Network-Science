# Calculating In-Degree and Out-Degree in Directed Graph

Dataset Description :In the file, each line represents an edge having "u v" where an edge is from u to v.

Written a python script that calculates In-Degree and Out-degree and plotted the graph accordingly.


 Outdegree: Total number of leaving vertices is known as outdegree.
 
 Indegree: Total number of entering vertices is known as indegree.
